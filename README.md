# Francis' Personal Website
Francis Indaheng, Fall 2018 VCG Capstone Project

### Description

I will design and code a portfolio website to display my projects, resume, and professional interests. Through this project, I hope to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic front- and back-end web development. The way I hope this website to function is to help recruiters visualize my resume in a "prettier" environment. That is, a more colorful, interactive, and less cramped way of viewing my various experiences.

### Technical Slack
**TODO**: Describe the languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools that went into your project. Make sure to add a brief description of its utility, unlike the list below.

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

I will mainly be using HTML to code the text of this website. However, I will also need to use CSS and JavaScript to code some of the backend functions such as navigation throughout the page.

### Implementation
**TODO**: Complete this while you're working on your project. Preferably, you're describing what steps you took for different parts of the project.

I plan to use Codeacademy to learn web development languages -- HTML, CSS, JavaScript. However, due to the short timeframe given for this projet, I will also refer to an article as a guide to build website from scratch (listed below in supplementary material). However, I will add more features by using a navigation system.

### Supplementary Material
**TODO**: Include any links to materials that might help people learn more about your project.
